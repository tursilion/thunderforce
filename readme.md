This is set of patches and notes on my creation of a Thunder Force multicart for the Sega Genesis, including cheat patches for the games.

The PCB is laid out with ExpressPCB's software, unfortunately, so it's kind of locked in at the moment.

No commercial binaries are included. You need to deal with that yourself. Just IPS files.
