<DIV class="entry_content ipsType_textblock ipsPad">																			I had a 
playthrough of TF2 and TF3 without incident, but TF4 was still having problems. 
I found two specific spots that locked up, and was able to save state them to 
track things down. Eventually, I found a second checksum routine at $781E, which 
was triggering after the power up animation where you get the enhanced 
CLAW.<BR><BR>It's pretty much the same as the first one:<BR>&nbsp;<BR>
<PRE class="prettyprint lang-auto linenums:0"> lea $80.w, A0
 moveq #$0,d0
 adda.l a0,a0
 adda.l a0,a0		&lt;--- $200
 move.w #$2b80,d7	&lt;--- to $AFFF
 subq.w #1,d7
782e:
 add.l (a0)+,d0
 dbra d7,$782e
 cmp.l $bff8.l,d0  &lt;-- d3fbb88a -- mine is c3eeb886
 bne $5aa6
 bra $2ece
</PRE>I 
set extra breakpoints and played through the end. The original checksum code at 
$5CAE was called in ten different places, and this new function was called after 
every white screen wipe.<BR><BR>So, had to change this extra checksum, and again 
the main cartridge checksum:<BR><BR>BFF8 - change "D3FB B88A" to "C3EE 
B886"<BR>018E - update to "08F5"
