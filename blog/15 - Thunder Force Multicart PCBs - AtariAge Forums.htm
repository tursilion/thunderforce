<DIV class="entry_content ipsType_textblock ipsPad">																			The PCBs 
arrived today, a little later than I hoped, but still with time to play with 
them.<BR><BR>For my first stab at a cartridge PCB, they're not bad. I went with 
the cheap non-solder-mask, non-silkscreen versions to test.<BR><BR>There were 
four problems with them.<BR><BR>The first problem was they were slightly too 
wide, it made for a very tight fit... I trimmed less than half a millimeter off 
the edge to solve that. I fixed this in the layout file.<BR><BR>The second was 
that the card edge was not beveled, but I knew this going in because ExpressPCB 
doesn't do beveling as far as I know. I used the dremel to bevel the edge as 
well. It's not perfect, but it works. ;)><BR><BR>The 
third was that one of my traces didn't actually make it to the pad -- it was 
there, but was just barely not touching. Fixed that both on the board and in the 
layout file.<BR><BR>The fourth was an outright layout error - one of the EPROM 
control pins was left floating when it needed to be tied high. That needs a 
jumper wire, but I patched that up too.<BR><BR>The final problem I simply didn't 
foresee. I had intended to use ZIF sockets on the first board to more easily 
test the ROMs, and I hadn't realized that the ZIF sockets were MUCH larger than 
the raw ICs, not to mention they wouldn't fit in the Genesis. So, I extended the 
pins on one socket, and attached just it for testing.<BR><BR><A title="tfmulticart.jpg - Size: 2.49MB, Downloads: 0"

<BR><BR>The good news, is that Thunder Force 2 and the menu work perfectly on 
this, without the oddities I saw on the previous cartridge. (At least so far). I 
am going to independently test 3 and 4 with the single EPROM approach before I 
got for soldering one together permanently.<BR><BR>But, before I went that far, 
I did one more thing. I felt bad that Thunder Force IV was not region free while 
2 and 3 were, so I undertook to fix that.<BR><BR>I found three parts that read 
the region register:<BR><BR>First part:<BR>
<PRE class="prettyprint lang-auto linenums:0">0482	move.b $a10001,d0		read version reg
	and.w #$80,d0			mask out region
	move.w d0,$f0b6.w		Store REGION at $f0b6
</PRE>Second 
part:<BR>
<PRE class="prettyprint lang-auto linenums:0">0542	move.b $a10001,d0		read version reg
	and.w #$40,d0			mask out tv
	bne invalid			if PAL, branch
	tst.w $f0b6.w			check region
	bne $620			go ahead and run if not Japan
invalid:
	bsr $2444			failure?
</PRE>third 
part (after Sega logo -- this is just deciding whether to say Technosoft or 
Tecnosoft):<BR>
<PRE class="prettyprint lang-auto linenums:0">c3a2	tst.b $a10001			test version register
	bmi $c3b4			branch if not Japan
</PRE>So, 
presumably, all we really need to do is set the "bne invalid" in the second 
block to "bra $620". Then, of course, we update the three game checksums 
previously discussed.<BR><BR>They were pretty paranoid about region coding, 
eh?<BR><BR>Anyway, the branch is too far for a short jump, so we end up 
overwriting both the bne and part of the tst.w. But, this should be 
okay.<BR><BR>So, at $54C, replace "6608 4a78" with "6000 00D2"<BR>At $15FF8, 
replace the checksum with "F9A3 23AF" - this should let you collect 1-ups<BR>At 
$BFF8, replace the checksum with "BDE6 6EE0" - this should let you clear the 
second half stages<BR>At $18E, replace the checksum with "0977" - this should 
let it boot.
