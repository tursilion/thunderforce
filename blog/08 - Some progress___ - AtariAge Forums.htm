<DIV class="entry_content ipsType_textblock ipsPad">																			I took a 
look at the startup issues in Thunder Force III, and found that it was crashing 
on the first vertical blank interrupt, which was set to vector into RAM. I found 
that TF3 (and TF4 for that matter) check the control registers to see whether 
they are doing first init or not, and skip a lot of set up in they are not. For 
TF3's sake, the result was a fatal crash.<BR><BR>Adding this code into the 
trampoline function fixed TF3:<BR>&nbsp;<BR>
<PRE class="prettyprint lang-auto linenums:0">move.w #0,$A11200	; put the Z80 (and YM2162) in reset
move.w #$8004,$c00004	; VDP R0 = 04 (disable IE0)
move.w #$8104,$c00004	; VDP R1 = 04 (disable IE1)
move.w #$8B00,$c00004	; VDP R11= 00 (disable IE2)
clr.l $A10008		; TF3, at least, uses these registers to decide whether to do a full init!
clr.l $a1000c		; zeroing them should force a proper initialization</PRE>I 
also added the TMSS code from the TMSS ROM -- basically checking if the Genesis 
has security hardware, and zeroing the security register if so, which is what 
the TMSS BIOS does. But I don't have a machine I can test that on... maybe it's 
not necessary.<BR><BR>Sadly, the above code patch did not fix TF4's lockup, so 
there is more to do there. Also, I looked more closely at TF2, and it shows two 
odd behaviours that the emulator does NOT -- for one, it always thinks it's in 
Japanese mode (even though the other games do not), and for two, it locks up 
when the game is started. But these two things happen only on hardware, and I 
don't have an easy way to test that right now, so I will next need to look at 
TF4.
