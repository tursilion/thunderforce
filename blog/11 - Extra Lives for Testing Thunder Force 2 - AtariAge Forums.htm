Force II - allow lots more lives. TF2 usually allows only 3-5 lives, and it's 
frankly, overly hard in places. So, for testing, I thought it would be nice to 
be able to select a lot more lives. (To get into the options menu, hold A while 
pressing Start on the title page).<BR><BR>Back in Regen, I did a RAM dump at 
both '5' lives and '3' lives, then loaded a diff. Only 2 values differed - at 
9829 was the values '4' and '2', which seemed likely (a later change looked like 
the display character.) I tried directly changing the value at 9829 to '23' 
(just at random), then moving DOWN off the option (because sideways would just 
wrap the value), and sure enough, it took, so this was likely it. '23' displayed 
as '36' - which is correct for hex-&gt;decimal, plus 1.<BR><BR>Setting a 
breakpoint on reading 9828 (since '9829' never triggered), and moving right, I 
got this bit of code at $6F22:<BR>&nbsp;<BR>
<PRE class="prettyprint lang-auto linenums:0"> btst #$3,D0		check joystick right
 beq $6F46		jump if not set
 addq.w #1,$ff9828.l	add '1' to life counter
 cmpi.w #$4,$ff9828.l	test against '4'
 bls x1			jump if less or equal
 move.w #$2,$ff9828.l	greater than 4, reset to '2'
x1:
 bsr $6f74		probably a display routine
</PRE>This 
is clearly the code to hack for increment - it contains both the max value and 
the reset value. I think 99 lives should be enough, so let's go ahead and change 
the maximum to that. It's only the max we need to change here. 99 in hexadecimal 
is $63, and subtract 1 for the counter, so $62.<BR><BR>At $6F30, replace "0004" 
with "0062".<BR><BR>We'll also reset the minimum lives to '1' so you can have a 
single life game - why not?<BR><BR>At $6f3A, replace "0002" with 
"0000".<BR><BR>The BEQ tells where to look for the other direction (probably), 
and looking at $6f46, sure enough, is the similar code:<BR>&nbsp;<BR>
<PRE class="prettyprint lang-auto linenums:0"> btst #$2,d0		check joystick left
 beq $6f68		jump if not set
 subq.w #$1,$FF9828.l	subtract '1' from life counter
 cmpi.w #$1,$ff9828.l	test against '1'
 bne x2			jump if not equal
 move.w #$4,$ff9828.l	reset to '4'
x2:
 bsr $6f74		same probable display routine
</PRE>Great! 
So we need to change the wrap around value, changing the '4' to $62.<BR><BR>At 
$6f5E, replace "0004" with "0062"<BR><BR>Then, to change the wrap point, replace 
the '1' with '$FFFF' (because it will have wrapped around).<BR><BR>At $6F54, 
replace "0001" with "FFFF".<BR><BR>Now, of course, we need to recalculate the 
checksum. Break on read of $18E, and load the newly modified ROM. D0 should 
contain the new checksum (if Regen let the loop finish before breaking). In this 
case I see "C986".<BR><BR>At $18E, replace "C8CA" with "C986"<BR><BR>That should 
now let you select 1-99 lives in the menu.<BR><BR><A title="TF299lives.jpg - Size: 83.48KB, Downloads: 0"
